Update the `AGENT.md` file to reflect the project. Look into the project for that.

Compress content if needed but don't delete any. Add content if needed. Keep the file clean, small and simple.

Include a overview of the project structure with descriptions for each folder/file next to it. Use `tree` to do that but ignore dependencies. Don't include the complete result, just the most important parts.

List your MCP servers and group them by service, add these services to the `AGENTS.md` with a small what comment what each service does.

User input to add to the `AGENT.md` file as content, rewrite it if needed:
