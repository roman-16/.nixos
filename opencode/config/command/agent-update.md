Update the `AGENT.md` file to reflect the project. Look into the project for that.

Compress content if needed but don't delete any. Add content if needed. Keep the file clean, small and simple.

Include a overview of the project structure with descriptions for each folder/file, use `tree` to do that but ignore dependencies.
