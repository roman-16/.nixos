Update the `AGENTS.md` file to reflect the project. Look into the project for that.

Compress content if needed but don't delete any. Add content if needed. Keep the file clean, small and simple.

The first thing in `AGENTS.md` should be commands which list the most important commands of the project.

Include a overview of the project structure with descriptions for each folder/file next to it. Use `tree` to do that but ignore dependencies. Don't include the complete result, just the most important parts.

List your MCP servers and group them by service, add these services with all their functions to the `AGENTS.md` file with a small what comment what each thing does.

User input to add to the `AGENTS.md` file as content, rewrite it if needed:
$ARGUMENTS
