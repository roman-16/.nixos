Update the `AGENTS.md` file to reflect the current project state.

Explore the project structure and document the most important folders and files with brief descriptions. Use the `tree` command to generate an overview, ignoring dependencies, and include only the key parts.

List MCP servers grouped by service, including all their functions with brief descriptions of what each does.

Add user-provided content from $ARGUMENTS, rewriting if necessary to fit the document.

Keep the file clean, concise, and organized. Compress content if needed but don't delete any.
